Simple DAQmx analog voltage controller completed as a part of graduate coursework.

Posted exactly as it was submitted for grading, including redundant comments and other bad practices.
This project was graded for functionality, and not for the code itself.

This project is intended to be viewed only in the context of the currently ongoing refactoring project,
which intends to update the project the adhere to better coding practices, and transition from WinForms
to WPF.
